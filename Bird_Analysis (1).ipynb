This project integrates data science techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover patterns that are critical for biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management.\n",

Key fields include Start_Time, End_Time, Scientific_Name, Sex, Distance, and conservation codes such as PIF_Watchlist_Status and NPSTaxonCode. The data preprocessing phase involved merging multiple sheets, standardizing formats, handling missing values using logical mappings (e.g., inferring Site_Name from Plot_Name), converting time fields into proper data types, and aligning taxonomy codes.\n",
